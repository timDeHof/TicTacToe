If I could start over...

I would start with a window that asks for the number of players based on the buttons "1" or "2".
if(player selected "1" button){
    ask for player's name  
    assign player's name to player one
    set player two to computer as default
    ask player to click "play" button to start game
}else{
    ask for player's name  
    assign player's name to player one
    ask for other player's name 
    assign other player's name to player two 
    ask any player to click "play" button to start game
}
once "play" button is clicked then a grid would appear, waiting for the player one first move.

After the first player's move, then the computer or player twos turn to pick a available empty square

After each player's move, ...
    the move should be check to see if its valid by comparing the move to array of empty squares.
    if(player's move is valid){
        update the board with the player's move added
        check if the move creates a winning combination
        if(winning combination is true){
            stop updating the board
            have an alert window appear saying "player "1 or 2" has won!"
        }else{
            continue the game
        }
    }else {
        ask the player to try again
    }
